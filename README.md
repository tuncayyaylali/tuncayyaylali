### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I' m Tuncay YAYLALI

I graduated from Istanbul Technical University, Department of Environmental Engineering, one of the oldest and most established universities in our country, by shaping my choice with the foresight that it will be an important discipline both on an international and national scale in line with the needs of the constantly developing and growing economy. After 6 years of experience in the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, I decided to continue working in the private sector, thinking that it would offer wider opportunities and add more value to my professional vision. In this context, I had middle and senior management experiences in various companies operating in the field of environment. 

In addition, I graduated from the Department of Business Administration as a High Honor Student in 2020. I have successfully completed two separate Masterâ€™s Programs on Environmental Management and Occupational Safety in 2020 and 2021.

During my professional experience, I have always been interested in the world of informatics due to my special curiosity. In this context, I have stepped into the world of data science for 2 years and continue my education. My biggest goal is to continue my career in business analytics, data engineering, data science and machine learning engineering and become one of the good full stack data scientists.

I have successfully completed the Data Science Specialization Training (Data MasTR), which was organized by Advancity & Miuul in cooperation with enocta and whose contents were prepared by Miuul, lasting 5 months and having a total of more than 300 hours of content. In the content of the program, we had the opportunity to receive training from experts in the fields of Python, SQL, CRM Analytics, Feature Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Rating & Sorting, Recommendation Systems, Machine Learning, Time Series, and develop applications based on real data sets provided by sponsors. I am continuing the Data Engineer Bootcamp at Miuul and Bootcamp Acceleration Program IX at Patika.dev. 

I have successfully completed the Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Bootcamp, which was organized by Veri Bilimi Okulu, lasting about 3,5 months. In the content of the program, we had the opportunity to receive training from experts in the fields of machine learning operations (Git&GitHub, Gitea, Linux, Shell Bash, Docker, AWS S3, IAM & EC2 Services, Minio, MLFlow, FastAPI & Pydantic, Kubernetes, Ansible & Terraform, CI/CD & Jenkins), and developed applications on the subjects and presented a Graduation Project.

Continuous improvement, continuous learning and change are among my most important values.
