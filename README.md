### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I' m Tuncay YAYLALI
I graduated from Istanbul Technical University, Department of Environmental Engineering in 1993. I have 24 years of professional experience in the field of Environmental Engineering, six years of which are in the public sector. I completed the Department of Business Administration in 2020, and two separate Master' s Programs in Environmental Management and Occupational Safety in 2020 and 2021, respectively.

I have stepped into the world of data science for 1 year and continue my education. In this context, I successfully completed the Data Science Specialization Training (Data MasTR) at Miuul lasting 5 months and the Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Bootcamp at Veri Bilimi Okulu lasting 3.5 months. I am continuing Miuul' s Data Engineer Bootcamp and am at the Graduation Project stage.

My goal is to continue my career in data engineering, data analysis, data science and MLOps engineering and become a good full stack data scientist. Time-management, problem solving, leadership, work ethic, attention to detail, and continuous learning are my most important values. I am married and have two sons.
