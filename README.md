### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I' m Tuncay YAYLALI

I graduated from Istanbul Technical University, Department of Environmental Engineering. After 6 years of experience in the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, I decided to continue working in the private sector, thinking that it would offer wider opportunities and add more value to my professional vision. In this context, I had middle and senior management experiences in various companies operating in the field of environment. 

In addition, I graduated from the Department of Business Administration as a High Honor Student in 2020. I have successfully completed two separate Masterâ€™s Programs on Environmental Management and Occupational Safety in 2020 and 2021.

During my professional experience, I have always been interested in the world of informatics due to my special curiosity. In this context, I have stepped into the world of data science for one year and continue my education. My biggest goal is to continue my career in data engineering, data analysis, data science and machine learning engineering and become one of the good full stack data scientists.

I have successfully completed the Data Science Specialization Training (DatamasTR), which was organized by Advancity & Miuul in cooperation with enocta and whose contents were prepared by Miuul, lasting 5 months and having a total of more than 300 hours of content. In the content of the program, we had the opportunity to receive training from experts in the fields of Python, SQL, CRM Analytics, Feature Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Rating & Sorting, Recommendation Systems, Machine Learning, Time Series, and develop applications based on real data sets provided by sponsors. I am continuing the Data Engineer Bootcamp at Miuul, the Bootcamp Acceleration Program IX at Patika.dev, and the Python Bootcamp at Global AI Hub.

I have successfully completed the Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) Bootcamp, which was organized by Veri Bilimi Okulu, lasting about 3,5 months. In the content of the program, we had the opportunity to receive training from experts in the fields of machine learning operations (Introduction to MLOPs, Introduction to ML Engineering, ML Development Process, Deployment Patterns and Tools, MLflow, API Development with FastAPI, Model Deployment with FastAPI, Deployment on EC2, Deployment on Docker, Deployment on Kubernetes, Deployment on VM, ML Pipelines, Detecting Drift, Packaging Python Code, How to Scale with Spark, CI/CD, Jenkins, Introduction to IaaC (Terraform), Introduction to Ansible, Introduction to Datascience on AWS), and developed applications on the subjects and presented a Graduation Project.

Continuous improvement and lifelong learning are among my most important values.
